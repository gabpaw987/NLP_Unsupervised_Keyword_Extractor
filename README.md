# NLP_Unsupervised_Keyword_Extractor

USAGE: Please use everything in jate-master for the main implementation of my scheme outlined in the documents and use RAKE or textRank for the alternative, easier implemenations that will perform worse in most cases but not all.The documents outline which technique is probably most suitable for your specific use case.

An unsupervised natural language processing approach to finding the most important semantic concepts from a programming source code documentation. This is used in the whole project of my company to gain an understanding of the source code and bug reports and automatically suggest code areas in the code that are likely to feature a bug to new developers to speed up their bug resolution process if they have never seen the code before. The different implementations of this scheme depend heavily on other NLP libraries for Java including JATE, Stanford CoreNLP, RAKE (in Python) and an implementation of TextRank.

Please see full English documentations for more detail on this project.
